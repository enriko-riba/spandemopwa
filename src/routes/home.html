                        <p>It is a period of civil war among various web technologies. The Rebel forces called Progressive Web
                                Applications (or PWA), striking from a hidden base in
                                <i>SPAN d.o.o.</i>, have won their first victory against the evil Empire's native applications.</p>
                        <p>The Rebel commander
                                <i>Mirna Marković</i> managed to steal secret plans to real time DB updates, materialize web
                                components, npm and webpack workflow.</p>
                        <p>At the same time pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, rebel Admiral
                                <i>Enriko Riba</i> races to implement high level support for serviceworkers and push notification
                                API that can save his people and restore freedom to the galaxy…</p>
                        <p>All this comes at a price. The evil Empire still prevails on the iOS system's. It is not clear how
                                and when will the PWA forces win but everyone hopes the war will end soon...</p>
